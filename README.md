# **Simple Python Calculator** 🖩  

## **Overview**  
This is a basic Python calculator that allows users to perform four arithmetic operations:  
➕ **Addition** (`+`)  
➖ **Subtraction** (`-`)  
✖️ **Multiplication** (`*`)  
➗ **Division** (`/`)  

The program ensures **valid operator input**, prevents **division by zero**, and organizes functions **modularly** for clean and reusable code.  

---

## **How It Works**  
1️⃣ The user enters the **first number**.  
2️⃣ The program asks for an **operation symbol** (`+, -, *, /`) and keeps asking until a valid one is entered.  
3️⃣ The user enters the **second number**.  
4️⃣ The program performs the calculation and displays the result.

## **Code Breakdown**  

- **`add(num1, num2)`** – Adds two numbers and returns the result.  
- **`sub(num1, num2)`** – Subtracts the second number from the first.  
- **`mult(num1, num2)`** – Multiplies two numbers.  
- **`div(num1, num2)`** – Divides the first number by the second (with zero-checking).  
- **`get_opp()`** – Ensures the user enters a valid operator (`+, -, *, /`). If not, it keeps asking.

## **Error Handling**  

⚠️ **Invalid Operator Handling** – If the user enters something other than `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, they are prompted again.  

⚠️ **Division by Zero Prevention** – If the user tries to divide by zero, they get an error message:  
`"Error: Division by 0 is undefined."`
