# simplecalculator_Python
This is a basic Python calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It ensures valid operator input, prevents division by zero, and uses modular functions for clarity. Users enter two numbers and an operation, and the program returns the result. A great project for practicing functions, loops, and input handling! ðŸš€
